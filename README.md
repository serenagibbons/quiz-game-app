# Individual Project 2

## Description and goal:
In this project, you will practice on using XML resource files, pictures, Android controls, intents and dialogs, persistent data.

You should develop your own individual solution to the following problem.

## Problem:
You need to create a quiz game with registration/login. The focus of this project is for you to create an app with several activities, data validation, passing data between activities, storing data for stats, and the use of a timer.

You should have in your app:
- A welcome screen (splash screen) with your app name and a picture.
- You should then move to a screen that asks the user for either to log in or to register.
- If the user clicks the registration page, the registration page should have fields for at least 'first name', 'family name', 'date of birth', 'email', and a 'password'.
- Validate that the entered data is not empty.
- Check that the entered data is correct (such as email validation, the first name should at least 3 char and not more than 30)
- If registration successful return to the previous screen.
- Enable login (it doesnâ€™t have to be linked to a database at this stage)
- Once user login, you should take them to the game.
- should have an activity that explains the rules of the game (quiz).
- should ask at least five questions.
- Should have at least one question with an answer of format multiple choices.
- Should have at least one question with an answer of format multiple answers.
- Store users answers and show a confirmation UI before accepting an answer.
- If the answer is confirmed then record it and check if correct, and then move to the next question.
- When the quiz finishes display the result.
- You should store the data on the phone, so if the user login later should see the history of playing the game and score (use a simple key-value or Java Files).
- You need to have a nice design.
- Make sure that you test your app at least on two different devices (phone and tablet) and for portrait and landscape modes.
